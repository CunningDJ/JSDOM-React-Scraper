# JSDOM-React Scraper

## Intro
This app is an experimental project that uses JSDOM-based backend scraping and React-based frontend visualizer to give a user a quick tool for harvesting analytics for a given url.

## Dependencies
* NodeJS & npm

## Getting started
1. Run `npm install` in both the `frontend/` and `/backend` directories.
2. See the different serve and build options in the READMES of the `frontend/` and `backend/`
    * For the **frontend**, you will have the option of activating a React dev server that will serve and update your React app on localhost, or to build a production-ready copy of the app at any time.
    * For the **backend**, you will have the option to transpile the Typescript-code into run-ready Javascript, and to run the server in DEV, TESTPROD, or PROD modes.
